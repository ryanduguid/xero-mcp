This MCP server allows Clients to interact with [Xero Accounting Software](https://www.xero.com).

## Get Started

1. Make sure [node](https://nodejs.org) is installed.

2. Create an OAuth 2.0 app in Xero to get a _CLIENT_ID_ and _CLIENT_SECRET_.

   - Create a free Xero user account (if you don't have one)
   - Login to Xero Developer center https://developer.xero.com/app/manage/
   - Click New app
   - Enter a name for your app
   - Select Web app
   - Provide a valid URL (can be anything valid eg. https://www.myapp.com)
   - Enter redirect URI: `http://localhost:5000/callback`

     > **Note:** Use HTTP with `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`, an explicit port and a callback path (e.g. `http://localhost:5050/my-path`). Set the same value as `XERO_REDIRECT_URI` in your MCP client config below. For `localhost`, the server listens on both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses, using the available family if the other is unsupported. An explicit IP address binds only that family. A port conflict on either requested address stops authentication before the browser opens.

   - Tick to Accept the Terms & Conditions and click Create app
   - On the left-hand side of the screen select Configuration
   - Click Generate a secret

3. Configure your MCP client:

   ### Claude Desktop

   Go to Settings -> Developers -> Local MCP Servers -> Edit Config and add the following to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "xero-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "xero-mcp@latest"],
         "env": {
           "XERO_CLIENT_ID": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
           "XERO_CLIENT_SECRET": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
           "XERO_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:5000/callback"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Restart Claude Desktop, or reload via Developer -> Reload MCP Configuration.

   ### Claude Code

   Run the following command to add the MCP server:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add xero-mcp \
     -e XERO_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
     -e XERO_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
     -e XERO_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/callback \
     -- npx -y xero-mcp@latest
   ```

   The server will be available in your next Claude Code session. To make it available across all projects, add `--scope user` to the command above.

4. When accessing a Xero tool for the first time, a Xero login page will pop up to ask your consent. Complete the auth flow and manually close the web page (as the Xero page will not auto close in this version)

   **Privacy alert: after completing the Xero OAuth2 flow, your Xero data may go through the LLM that you use. If you are doing testing you should authorize to your [Xero Demo Company](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Use-the-demo-company).**
